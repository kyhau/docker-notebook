# Docker Image Creation, Management, and Registry

```bash
# When the Dockerfile is in the current context (directory), you build it with an image name and tag with the
# -t option followed by the image:tag and the directory context of the file, in this case '.'.
docker build -t myimage:v1 .

# From the list below, which option would you add to the 'docker login' command in order to provide the username
# to the repository in order to log in?
--username=[USERNAME]
